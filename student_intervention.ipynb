    "- Logistic Regression: The first one I chose was Log Reg because conceptualy, it is a very simple algorithm. Being easy to understand what it's doing, I thought it would be nice to use it here for comparisons with the other choices.\n",
    " - Wikipedia lists many applications, on in particular is used in medicine to calculate the so called Trauma and Injury Severity Score (TRISS) [1].\n",
    " - LG is very fast compared to other algorithms and very simple (easy interpretation).\n",
    " - Situations when it can perform poorly are when there are too many features and few examples (curse of dimensionality - CoD) and with categorical data, since this will create sparseness.\n",
    " - LG works well with a few (~10) samples for each class. Given that our dataset is not very large, I believe LG can be helpful. Due to its simplicity, it is also less prone to overfitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Decision Trees: DTs are also simple algorithms, easy to follow. But they add some complexity to the model when compared to LG, so I thought it would be nice to test it along LG. Also widely used, for example of an application in Physics to classify different types of elementary particles: [2].\n",
    " - Fast, simple to understand and to interpret. Nice visual interpretation.\n",
    " - It is prone to overfit the data, it requires careful study of the hyper parameters. Also, it also suffers from the CoD and requires a good ratio of samples to features.\n",
    " - Given the nature of the data, where it is likely that there is no true underlying model but only correlations among the different features, DTs perform well in these types of analysis with careful check of its parameters.\n",
    " \n",
    "- Adaboost: Given that I decided to use DTs, I thought that boosting would be a natural pedagogical choice to compare with DTs. Since Adaboost can use DTs as its weak leaner, it is nice to see if an emsemble of trees can do a better job . Application: the Viola-Jones face detector [3]. As the document on boosting provided describes, adaboost:\n",
    " - is computationally efficient, there are no difficult parameters to set and it is versatile.\n",
    " - is susceptible to uniform noise and requires enough data for the weak learner to perform better than random guessing.\n",
    " - Since one can expect DTs to work well in this problem, this makes boosting a natural candidate.\n",

Remember that you will need to train and predict on each classifier for three different training set sizes: 100, 200, and 300. Hence, you should expect to have 9 different outputs below — 3 for each model using the varying training set sizes. In the following code cell, you will need to implement the following:\n",
    "- Import the three supervised learning models you've discussed in the previous section.\n",
    "- Initialize the three models and store them in `clf_A`, `clf_B`, and `clf_C`.\n",
